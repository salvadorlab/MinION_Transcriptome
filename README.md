1) A comprehensive examination of Nanopore native
RNA sequencing for characterization of complex
transcriptomes
2) Studying bacterial transcriptomes using RNA-seq
3) start with tailfinder, make sure if the information given in the data summaries are correct. (especially direct RNA sequencing, is it polyA tailed?)
